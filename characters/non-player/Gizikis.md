*"Due to power of memes powers he is everyone you ever met and also probably you."*

Gizikis first appeared in the [[Post-Lortest Campaign]] as a one of the parties running for power between [[Yuan Ti Purifiers]] and [[The Great Hellenic Unification front]].  He was regarded as one of the opposing parties to [[Tetriam Partem]].

Later he appeared in the [[Bokor Campaign]] and [[Hansen Campaign]] as a steersman for the group and died during the betrayal by [[Freddy Mercury the dragon]]

## Backstory
He was born in to a family of common birth who sent him to a elite school which co-aligned with his wish to pursue writing. When he arrived there he was met with hostility from the youth of the noble class who belittled him because of his status, 
this led him to focus more on his studies and complete the school against the efforts of the other students.

After he completed his studies in school he was against his wishes he was assigned by his father. His feeling was even more amplified by the fact that the people who were upset about his previous success took the opportunity to mock him.

Against those setbacks he managed to inherit the post office and started to move in political cycles so he could undercut the mockery that was directed to him.

In those circles he engaged in debate where he wasn't very popular due to his anxiety and mediocre rhetorical skills and stayed out of any government power he might attain because of his aversion from policy creation.
but because of his opinion that people of Lortest should rule themselves  he was targeted by the Hellenic secret agencies that decided to use him as a scapegoat for their campaign which they a enacted by enacting a raid on his home and sabotaging the post office.

At the end they thrusted him to a prison where he was severely beaten. This resulted in him writing a essay called *Traitors against Traitors* where he expressed his opinion that [[The Great Hellenic Unification front]] betrayed people of [[Post-Lortest Fortress]] in their campaign against fraction that wanted to fall under the influence of [[Draconic Junathsland]].

During this stressful period he decided to buy expensive sunglasses from volcanic glass as the only reward for his work to hide his expression that could've shown his social awkwardness and have an item that could serve as a token to control his stress by remind himself of what he stands for and making a mental barrier so he could accomplish what he needs to do. 
He made a story that he started believing that if his father lived he would given them to him when he would see his accomplishments

Against his aversion for the ruling political scene he wanted to oppose [[Yuan Ti Purifiers]] though he couldn't accomplish much due to his small influence in political circles.

This set his on radar of [[The Great Hellenic Unification front]] that started to perceive him as a possible complication so they decided to remove him from the public and put him in prison with no intention of allowing him to leave in future and letting him die during his stay.

When he thought he will soon die of hunger he started screaming for several hours and to his call answer [[Abaddon]]. He wasn't strong believer in gods. Mostly he just believed that if he will live a good life  than [[Mr.Chandler]] will reward him but now even that small believe failed him. 
So when [[Abaddon]] proposed a contract where Gizikis could even keep his soul because he saw the potential of him as a political figure. He accepted it and was helped to escape from the prison.
[[Abaddon]] then started to spread myths about Gizikis, manipulating outcomes of things and told him that he has given him the confidence and charisma he needed, which was at least partially truth on the charisma part, and with that he convinced Gizikis to change the way he conducted himself.

Soon Gizikis started to gain traction because he presented suitable alternative to the fractions that were hated at that time. 

When Hellenicia noticed that Gizikis became highly dangerous to their interests in [[Post-Lortest Fortress]] they decided to send [[Kerenevsky]] to handle the problem.

At last he won with the help of [[Abaddon]] who gave his supporters mainly from the rural areas help of the magical variety in their conflicts. 

Against the best efforts of the established office [[Lortest Empire]] fell into economic crisis that was considered unavoidable. In this moment [[Abaddon]] decided to give him his servants as a work force to mitigate the crises which led to major economic dependency on them.

[[Abaddon]] than later used it to exert pressure on Gizikis to give up his power over the empire and his soul to him under the threat of war against his servants. This led Gizikis to choose the only viable solution he had perceived and agreed to this arrangement making himself puppet of [[Abaddon]].

This allowed [[Abaddon]] to start a war with the [[state of Hellenicia]] even though victory of [[Lortest Empire]] was improbable.
Their chances were shattered when Hellenicia recovered faster than anticipated and gods decided to join forces to turn the land and sea against him.

Even after this [[Abaddon]] refused to give up which led to massive depletion of resources of [[Lortest Empire]] both material and living but when even that failed he decided to say "it's abaddonin' time" giving Gizikis his soul back and left the offensive with his servants which resulted in it's complete collapse.

Gizikis decided that rather than getting captured by the Hellenic armies he will travel to [[Islandic realm]] with three ships with Hellenic navy in pursuit. 
The first of the three ships was sunk by their pursuers which led the second one to surrender. The last ship decided to stage a coup and left him on a desert island.

The last point of his mockery was the second ship that ventured to his island, after it's crew was eaten by a sea monsters, maybe by the whims of gods.
