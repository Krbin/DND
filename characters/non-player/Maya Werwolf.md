She was a leader of the local [[werewolf]] village near [[Sorrow Peak]] before she was assassinated by [[Sorrow Peaks's Baron]] which was framed on [[Ivoria's of Sorrow Peak]].

She was the their leader after her husband died in [[Ivoria]] attacks. Her leadership position was contested by opposing faction that later used her assassination to gain control and subsume the [[werewolfs]] under [[Sorrow Peaks's Baron]].

Afterwards she stayed at [[Sorrow Peak]]'s palace until the end of the [[Sorrow Peak Campaign]] where she let her soul be bet on the [[Game Of Gods]].
