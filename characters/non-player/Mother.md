Creature capable of mimicking speech.

# Doctors note 36

It would appear that due to inbreeding mother has been rendered sterile. What a shame,she was one of my most sucesfull experiments so far. SHe burring and tunel navigating ability is greater than one of the kobolds. If i could finish my breeding project there is no doubt i would create a creature that could take on multiple Bullets underground and ravage their nests. I will try to get her to breed but no matter what kind of partner i find the children are always stillborn. This has been recently putting some strains onto her psyche making her more volatile.
