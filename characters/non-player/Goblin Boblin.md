Entity known as Goblin Boblin which is a goblin with absurdly weak stats that is being encountered at random throughout the game.

He studied at the [[Adventuring academy of Ther-En]]. 
Then after his party died he joined goblins to stage a ambush on [[third party]] which failed and he dissipated to nothing.
