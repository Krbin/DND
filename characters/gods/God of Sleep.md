the god of sleep.  
One of the most powerful gods of this realm, just a mere sleeping is pledging a ritual to him. He sleeps most of the time creating his beautiful kingdom of pure art in his dream dimension that can be entered surprisingly through sleep unidentifiable by any non-sleep dimension language. However since the Predecessor gods cursed him for not helping them he has a hard time sleeping and his sleep is light. So he made his sheep like herald that keeps talking when he is not asleep about this realm or hell, describing it as a book full of heroes, tho history of this realm or hell would never beat the history of the dream realm it is enough to keep him entertained. He is also the reason most of gods don't sleep/fear sleeping since they can fall asleep and be cached by the beauty of the dream realm. Gods captured in dream realm can sleep for centuries if not awoken.
