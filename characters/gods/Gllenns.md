Â The god of nature.  
She can't control nature or evolution but can modify and bend it. She is just like any other god extension of a natural force. Her followers are not some neanderthals, because they believe that progress and nature is not exclusive. She also suffers from horrible rage attacks once every few years that are followed by natural disasters. After her rage issue is over she is unusually affectionate and kind.
