The god without a purpose. Sun with Many Hands is one of the oldest living “gods” of this realm born of the incestious intercourse when the previous God of Sun forced himself on his sister the goddess of moon and fertility. Sun with Many Hands was shortly after aborted, beaten to near death and left to die in an unknown cave system. Sun with Many Hands was however resilient survived the entire process along with the rot of his tissue and hid deep underground where he seeks being forgotten. Sun with Many Hands will even attempt to kill you if you refer to him by any name. Unfortunately cultists of Seathbaed found out about his existence and started to refer to him as the Sun with Many Hands. It is unknown what powers gives you worshipping the Sun with Many Hands but one thing is certain. Sun with Many Hands does not want to be worshipped and it will actively seek to kill its followers.
