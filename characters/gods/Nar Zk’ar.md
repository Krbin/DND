 the god of hunger and sea. Nar Zk’ar causes high tide and low tide by swallowing and spitting out a large quantities of water while trying to eat all kinds of sea creatures to satisfy his hunger. Unlike other gods Nar Zk’ar is probably not sentient and became god by being worshipped by most of the merfolk species. However Nar Zk’ar is aware of being a god to some degree. Followers of Nar Zk’ar are seen as degenerates by other people but it is possible to workship Nar Zk’ar and some other god.
