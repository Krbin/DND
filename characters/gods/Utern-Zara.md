The goddess of healing the hard way.
Goddess of healing, medicine, pain, salvation and disease.  
Her followers follow a “There is no salvation without suffering.” and “Pain brings relief” doctrine of healing. Lethargic medics perform their horrifying duty like cutting off hands and legs, sewing wounds with fire or stitching curing diseases with potent venom with no anesthetics on fully aware patients. Just to let their patients go through a slow painful process of regenerating lost parts of their bodies. (If you ask elves or moles they will swear that this gruesome method of healing is why some draconian, human or gnoll soldiers suffer from such fear of doctors). Utern-Zara requires almost no rituals but take “sacrifices” in blood and pain of her patients. Also the fun part is that if she shows her bandaged second face it is a sing of a plague that is going to ravage the lands.  
Main races of interest: Humans, Lizartfolks, Gnolls, were-rats and to some degree humans
