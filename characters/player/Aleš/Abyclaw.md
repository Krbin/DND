 He is a [[Tabaxi]] paladin of vengeance that first appeared in the [[2nd Hansen's Campaign]] on a island where he was trying to stop cultists from completing a ritual from which he was convinced otherwise by the party.

  He is followed by 3 [[Kobolts]] that are his servants and are convinced that their master is the ultimate destroyer or something like that.
