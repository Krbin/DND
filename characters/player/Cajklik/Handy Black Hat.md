(a horse race fighter)
Before the race there were 4 major events that shifted him into the man.
1. He lost of an arm in a fight against that thing as he calls it 
2. The find and rescue of Rudý dráp([[Red Claw]]) 
3. A scroll that allowed him to learn mage hand 
4. a war-forged deconstruction to make his robotic arm. 
  
Handy cant remember names including his own one so instead he makes up nicknames to remember people for himself.
After losing the race the kobolds that he helped one time asked him to join there shop where he started to make mechanical creations similar to his.
