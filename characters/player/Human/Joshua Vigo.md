He was raised by the temple of [[Tymora]] from his youth. He was all the best behaving child and sometimes was causing trouble. (12 years) When the fire started he was in his quarters sleeping and he was woken up by screams of clerics. When he was trying to find out what was happening he met an extravagant girl [[Merisa Anna Geara Uno]] who he knew for replacing the coin of [[Tymora]] with a coin with two heads. They took with them only a few personal possessions. When they tried to run out, a burning girder fell from the ceiling and one of the clerics lifted it up so they could escape. Because of the current political situation, they traveled to [[city of Hellenicia]], where he met an old paladin of [[Tymora]] Isel, who gave him armor, shield and sword and taught him how to use them. He died year later. Then they lived in the Island realm, where he worked as a sailor and a guard on merchant ships. Then they traveled to AÅ¡telbat because [[Merisa]] wanted to live an adventurous life.
