She is a member of [[Axehunters]] and was in the party during [[the mudbeast incident]].

### Backstory
She was born as an illegitimate child in a Hellenic court, her mother being an elf and her father being Chandler's inquisitor. Her father was largely absent from her life, so she grew up in a monastery as an orphan. Despite this, she received an allowance from her father, whom she knew about.

She spent significant time on the streets, engaging in petty crimes for amusement. She managed to evade punishment for these actions by manipulating her father, but in time she grew tired of and the severity of her crimes escalated, leading to a few murders. This continued until new emperor Antonio Di Graci restricted the power of the inquisition and her father was executed for corruption. This allowed the continuation of investigations into her crimes, forcing her to flee from Hellenicia and change her identity.

And though she abandoned her passion for killing humans she couldn’t abandon it entirely so she chose to hunt monsters instead. 

For some time she worked with different adventure parties but in the end, parted ways due to people not liking her true personality that was shown in her actions from time to time. Which mostly resulted in a murder spree to relieve her emotions.
