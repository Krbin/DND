Vall is a high elf druid who was raised inside of a forest by her master who was exiled from [[Elven Citadel]] for operating a brothel. 
She was part of the [[Gold square Race Campaign]] where she joined the party during their travel across the border of the swarm of [[Draconic Junathsland]]. 
She later left with [[Four]] after the campaign.
