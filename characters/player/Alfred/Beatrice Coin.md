Definitely not former Identity of [[Rose Evenwind]]
A fighter who grew up on stories of some unknown hero named Alex. Her father is a  governor of some city in the north but it seems she doesn’t want to derive her fame from him. To sum it up she is the annoying heroic type with too much focus on glory.
 
A daughter of [[Dorcan Coin]].
