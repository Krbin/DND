If two races mate with each other. The offspring will be member of the one of the two races the chance is universally 50/50 and not hybrid. Except for these scenarios:  
  
Neko – [[Human]] x tabaxi

Kitsune - [[Human]] x vixen  
Innu - [[Human]] x wolfman 

Tiefling – [[Human]] x demon (or some other demonussy shit)

Half elf - human x elf (if the offspring breeds with elf the offspring will be elve, if with human, the offspring will be human)

Dragonborn - [[Human]] x dragon

Genasi - [[Human]] x genie

Half orc - human x orc  
Human x dwarves = 50%chance human and 50% chance dwarve, however the if the offspring mate with same race (human or dwarve there is still 50% chance it will be human and 50% it will be dwarve)
