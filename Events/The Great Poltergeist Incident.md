The event can is recognized to be started when [[Pedro von Poltergeist]] started collecting parts of one of the [[Predecessors]] in order to resurrect him and extract from him knowledge to help in in his goal.

It is under speculation that the [[Predecessor]] whom [[Pedro von Poltergeist]] resurrected decided to take revenge because of their loss in  [[the Great Predecessor War]] and told him how to open the seal to released [[Giff]].

Due to the developments on the continent the [[Capybaras]] decided to start  [[the Capybara Invasion]].

Even against the efforts of the [[Magical Association]] and a team of adventuresses tried to stop him to opening the [[Giff Seal]]
