Bokor campaign was a campaign where the main goal was to kill Bokor for various motivations that he didn't (kidnapping [[Aerich]]'s family, killing [[Hansen Laus]]'s house') do (putting [[Viv Decor]]'s brother to jail, using drugs to enhance the productivity of the workers'). The campaign ended when the party made a deal with Bokor and handed over [[Hansen Laus]] to him. Later the campaign transition to [[Hansen's Campaign]].

The campaign in a middle of a city where our group had wanted to join the resistance movement when Bokor attacked the town killing everyone who didn't surrender.

Our group fled by a rowboat onto a ocean leaving the original owner of the boat on the land.
After we spent some time on the ocean we crashed into an deserted island where we met [[Joe Shmou]], who claimed that he is an common officer.
With him there was a stranded with a large broken ship.
