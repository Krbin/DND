It started after [[Hansen Laus]] toom something dear to the characters.
They first met on a boat arranged by Hansen upon which [[The Librarian]] took their sear as a captain trough unanimous lack of interest. 
The party travel trough random sorry locations most of which I am too lazy to remember.
There was a portal gate spitting Demons and other creatures of hell fighting some [[Gizikis]] alter-ego and we were at a giant snail, remnant of the old campaign filled with hatered for [[Hansen Laus]], and a group of same minded people on it's back as it if was moving island. 
We were on a [[Dragoness rider]]'s island whose name I don't remember and offered us asylum. Meanwhile we missed two [[Sea Ninja]] towers with magical items.
We were at a island with a school of fanatical [[Mild Soldiers of Hansen's academy]].
We did few other bullshit things and then [[The Librarian]] reveled that they were [[Lorida Ashington]] all along.
We stole a gattling gun, french elf and a femboy from a mansion while we were trying to save a wife that was a demon and disguise releasing all the other creatures by burning their contracts at the hands of [[The Librarian]].
Then [[Caletal]] sacrificed himself to save 
the dark elf I don't remember.
Shortly after that I left and the rest is history.


Party:
[[Blyat-man]]
[[Caletal]] 
[[Leif]]
[[The Librarian]] later revealed to be [[Lorida Ashington]].
