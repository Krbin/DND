Introduced as a [[Ebravo Eskanor]] he took from every adventurer a thing that they were fond of:
[[Atirra]] - they tried to kidnap his wife
[[Lisa Amakir]] - her eye
[[Alruna Evenstar]] - the petrified head of her father
[[Gabriel Heartfelt]] - memories of his best friend
[[Grace]] - burned her inn to the ground

He then engaged them in fights from most of which they run off. Later when they finally managed to fatally wound him. He reviled that he attacked them because he wanted to force them to go back to adventuring so they can stop [[The Great Poltergeist Incident]]
