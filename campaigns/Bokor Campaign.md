Bokor campaign was a campaign where the main goal was to kill Bokor for various motivations that he didn't (kidnapping [[Aerich]]'s family, killing [[Hansen]]'s house') do (putting [[Viv Decor]]'s brother to jail, using drugs to enhance the productivity of the workers'). The campaign ended when the party made a deal with Bokor and handed over [[Hansen]] to him. Later the campaign transition to [[Hansen Campaign]].
