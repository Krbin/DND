The campaign started after the party from [[Bokor's Campaign]] joined [[Bokor]] by trading [[Hansen Laus]] to join his ranks.

Their first mission was to protect the prison island which was holding [[Hansen Laus]] from attack of the [[Lizardfolk pirates]] by ramming their ship [[Crow's feather]] into the ship of the lizard folk which totally failed because they failed to account for the fact that the lizardfolk ship will just circle the island.

Afterwards when they arrived to the island they successfully held the beach against the landing of the [[Lizardfolk pirates]] during which [[Hansen Laus]] escaped from the prison with his fellow inmates with the help of [[Tiamat]] by betraying [[Raven Queen]]. #missing-information 



The campaign ended when [[Scarecrow]] and [[Freddy Mercury the dragon]] betrayed the party when they were under the pursuit of [[Hansen Laus]]'s ships when [[Scarecrow]] placed [[anti-magic field]] device to suppressed the party's magic casters which was secretly supplied by [[Hansen Laus]].

[[Freddy Mercury the dragon]] betrayed the party by convincing them to remove fake elemental breath suppression device and then eating [[Viv Decor]] that was removing it.
