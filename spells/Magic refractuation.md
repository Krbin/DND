Even thou much prefered to Untern-Zara's medicine magic is not a perfect healing procedure.

However tumours, scares, disfigurement and other stuff can be cured with some more magic there is a thread that can not be simply fixed using magic.
  

Using magic to heal wound after amputation of refractuated organ/tissue is highly not recommended, because it can cause further Magic Refractuation. The best way to treat Magic Refractuation is either a wish spell or an amputation/removal of affected tissue and treatment using non-magical procedures. Magic Refractuation is thankfully a non-recurring phenomenon in patients if treated well.

The most famous person suffering with Magic Refractuation was Olexij Kerenevsky.
