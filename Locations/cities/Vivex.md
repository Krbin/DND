Originally named "[[Tresholský Šek]]" which was controlled by [[Dwarf]]s now owned by Kobolts

Together with [[Koltest]] and [[D'nat Taoulou]] it is one of the few cities where Kobolts are the ruling class.

There are incentives to join [[Draconic Junathsland]]  but are denied because that would give them seats  at the council which other Draconic species don't want to allow
