Directly under [[Sorrow Peak]] when you descend by the underground rail and than venture trough the systems of caves you arrive to the Underdark. 

There are two pathways one is through [[the mountain of skulls]] around [[the lake of forsaken souls]]. 

It is the place where the [[Game Of Gods]] was played during the [[Sorrow Peak Campaign]].
